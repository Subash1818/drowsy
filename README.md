# Drowsiness-Detection-And-Preventing-Accident-By-Using-K-Nearest-Neighbor-Knn-Algorithm
Detection of drowsiness of a person who drives a vehicle to avoid the accident by calculating Eye Aspect Ratio and Mouth Aspect Ratio using separate formula. And averaging them by using the specific formula of calculating the MOE value. K-Nearest Neighbor [KNN] algorithm is used as classifier to predict the accuracy of the dataset.
